Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Laravel test description

A Laravel application which stores data about attractions.

All users should be able to view any approved attractions in the database.

Authenticated users should be able review the attractions, and leave a rating between 1-5.  Each user should only be allowed to create one review for an attraction, however they should be able to update their own review at a later date.

Users with administrator access should be able to add, edit and delete attractions from the system. They should also have the option to review and hide any inappropriate reviews.
